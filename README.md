# My-understandings-about-neural-network
  I write my understandings about deep learning in this repository. 
  
  Currently I focus on adverisarial samples and the explainations of the limitations on neural network.
  
  One sentence conclusion: Neural network is a nonlinear mapping of Y=f(X), where X can be anything(Images,Voice,Words,etc) described by data with Y as corresponding labels and the function f can be learned autonomously with back-propagation,during testing a sample X'(same/similar to X) can be correctly mapped to the label Y.
  
  Limitations: 
  1.BP need very large training samples if the network is very big or the function f is too complex.
  2.Neural network is discriminative models which is very vulnerable to adversarial samples.
  3.Multi nonlinear affine layer makes it hard to explain after trained. 
  
  Frontiers:
  1.Bayesian neural network
  2.Learning to learn
